### 1. Motivation

Living in the year 2016, one can hardly deny that information technology has found
a way into nearly every aspect of our modern lives. We tell our computers simple instructions,
chained together in ever-increasing complexity, which come together to create all
of the websites, applications, and services we enjoy today.

Like any machine, a program is only as good as the people who built it.
And being imperfect creatures, humans make mistakes. For the most part, evaluating
the health of a code base is much like evaluating any traditional machine. We can
take it apart, look inside, and make sure each part performs like we expect it to.

Unfortunately, translating lines of code into abstract notions of interactions and hierarchies
can be challenging. In the words of legendary computer scientist Donald Knuth,
> "The psychological profiling [of a programmer] is mostly the ability to shift levels
> of abstraction, from low level to high level. To see something in the small
> and to see something in the large"

So while our brain is still our best tool, it only seems natural to want to leverage our
ability to perceive things visually. Enter Code.MD, a code base visualization tool
that allows software developers to see key architectural patterns and complexity measures,
 *using our eyes*.

Armed with an enriched understanding of how a code base is built, developers can make
informed design decision that promote better code, better applications, better profit,
and happier users.
